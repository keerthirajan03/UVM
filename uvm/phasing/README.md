<p>This example illustrates the sequence of different phases in UVM. Phases are a way of synchronizing different verification components such that each component proceeds to the next phase only when all components have finished their tasks in the current phase. The only phase that consumes simulation time is the run_phase.</p>

<p>Execute the command as </p>
<pre>
  $> irun -f irun.f
